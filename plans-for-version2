  1. Reorganize the military script
    1.1 Going away from divsions made up of 3 infrantry brigades and going towards divisions with artillery, anti-tank and/or engineers. More variety
  2. Political
    2.1 Baltic
      2.1.1 Estonia and Latvia had an authoritarian government since 1934, Lithuenia had an authoritarian government since the military coup of 1926 under the Lithuanian Nationalist Union and you sure can bet they haven't forgotten about Polish-Lithuanian war of 1919-1920 and a failed Polish attempt at a coup d-etat in 1919 hoping to install a pro-Polish government that would support a Lithuanian-Polish union
      2.1.2 Also, "1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania" is going to be very important, let's keep that in mind. It happened on March 17, 1938 so about 2 years into the game (we're starting in 1936) but let's remember about it. What it basically was: Lithuania had no diplomatic relations with Poland and one of the demands was to re-establish those, additionally it demanded that Lithuania amends its constitution and acknowledge Vilnius as a Polish city and no longer a capital of Lithuania. 9 nationalistic organizations urged Smetona, Lithuanian president, to completely reject the ultimatum, however, gen. Stasys Rstikis argued that a military victory over Poland would be impossible. The ultimatum has been accepted
      2.1.3 Now, where does that bring us? Well, all three Baltic countries albeit small all had authoritarian governments, all were still rather shaky, none had international support. Lithuania could've seen this as an opportunity to band together and hit Poland together to reclaim the Vilnius region for Lithuania and kick something to Latvai.
      2.1.4 Could Estonia and Latvia agree to this?
        2.1.4.1 Latvia since their military coup of 1934 was under the State of War instead of their Parliament and Constitution and has been increasing state control over economy, infrastructure etc. In 1935 buyouts and liqudations of German and Jewish owned companies became a norm. By 1939 it was the richest of the Baltic countries with GDP per capita higher than Finland or Austria. Looking just at that it seems like they could have been confident in themselves enough to join this plan, provided they would acquire additional territory. Sure, we could point out that after Munich Agreement Latvia proclaimed absolute neutrality on December 13, 1938, Soviet Union announced that it will defend Latvia's independence, and Germany signed non-aggression treaty on June 7, 1939... buuuuuuuut Munich Agreement happens 2 years into the game and at the point where war is absolutely imminent and Latvia is literally between a growing III Reich and a forever-hungry Soviet Union. Absolute neutrality really was the only way to go, especially to keep their growing industry. After getting Estonia and Lithuania to attack Poland they could have enough self-confidence to go for it. Especially in 1936, just after the coup... :thinking-face:
        2.1.4.2 Estonia... in 1934 Konstantin Pats carried out a coup to prevent a paramilitary anti-socialist organisation - Vaps Movement - from taking over the government through normal election process. Vaps shared some aspects of fascist movements while openly criticizing Nazi and being anti-socialist. Pats then went on to silence his opposition, suspend the Parliament and constitution, and suppress civil and political rights. This is known as the "Era of Silence" which historically ended in 1938... technically (although the opposition party only had 16/64 seats in the parliament after the elections) and in 1940 practically when Soviet Union began occupation of Estonia. Estonia is the most problematic here because there really isn't much to hang onto. They were mostly neautral, there was no bloodshed, Era of Silence was actually pretty lax, and Pats' rule is called "Authoritarian Democracy"...
      2.1.5 This above here isn't even all that important because apparently, according to Brtiannica (https://www.britannica.com/event/Baltic-Entente#ref104783) in November 1923 Latvia and Estonia formed a bilateral-defense agreement and after they renewed it in February 1934, they invited Lithuania. On September 12, 1934 Lithuania signed the treaty. And there you have it. At this point all you need is what Germans did in Gliwice in 1939 ("Gleiwitz incident") and Lithuania goes to war with Poland... immediately dragging the other two nations into it
    2.2 Balkans
      2.2.1 Okay, let's start with Greece joining WW1 in 1918 and breaking German-Bulgarian front which caused Bulgaria to drop out of the world. In WW2 Germany and Bulgaria would invade Yugoslavia and Greece together. This already creates a foundation for Greek-Bulgarian war. Additionally, for Bulgaria, in 1919 signed Treaty of Neuilly where Bulgaria lost the coast to Greece, all Macedonian territory to Yugoslavia, and Dobruja to Romania. Bulgaria has the most reasons to go to war again, especially after Tsar Boris took over the authoritarian regime and banned opposition parties. Greek-Bulgarian war? Maybe? But also war with Romania? See 2.2.4
      2.2.2 Yugoslavia was growing closer to Germany and Italy which would lead to treaty of friendship between Yugoslavia and Italy in 1937. After that Yugoslavia would be heavily influenced by the Axis powers leading to complete dependency on German market by 1939 (90% of all exports went to Germany). In 1931 Hitler invaded Yugoslavia and created the Independent State of Croatia. What does that give us? It's not much, but basically Yugoslavia would not do anything to endanger Germany or Italy, which means that when Greece goes to war with Bulgaria we could expect at least a harsh diplomatic note from Yugoslavia. Pushed just a little bit by Germany it could lead to Yugoslavian attempt to protect Bulgaria... It's a stretch, I'll give you that.
      2.2.3 Albania is really interesting: in 1931 it took a massive loan from Italy, in 1933 it declined Italian demands and began policy of nationalization and dismissed Italian military advisers. In 1934 it signed trade agreements with Yugoslavia and Greece... Not much to hang onto so far buuuuut when we include the fact that their army was mainly financed by Italy we start seeing a bigger picture here. Same like Yugoslavia - it just needs a push to join the war against Greece
      2.2.4 Romania? 1913 - Second Balkan War where Romania took Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria. 1917 - Bessarabia unites with Romania and calls in Romanian troops to protect it from Soviets. 1920 - Treaty of Trianon which settled border disputes with Hungary (Romania gains part of Transylvania, Hungarians form 31% of the population there and 38% country-wide, in 1930 they demanded political autonomy, which was refused by Bucharest). 1937 - General elections where anti-semitic Iron Guard wins 15% of the total votes. 1938 - King Carol II abolishes parliamentary regime and rules as a dictator. Romania lost a lot in terms of human and natural resources during World War 1 and even by 1939 its industry did not have the technology and machines required for continued growth. High birth rates in rural areas but also high mortality rate, especially among children. Aside from that Bulgaria is now a huge multi-cultural country, with enourmous internal issues, without a strong, modernized military, with Soviet Union on one side and angry neighbors on the other...
      2.2.5 Hungary
        2.2.5.1 Between 1918-1920 Hungary went through "Hungarian People's Republic" which hoped to be neutral to the point where it literally disarmed its own military, then "Hungarian Soviet Republic" ("Republic of the Councils") which started the Red Terror and murdered several hundred people, mostly scientists and intellectuals (nothing surprising if you look at the history of Communism) but also had some victories against the Czechoslovakians and planned to march on Romania... only to flee to Austria with Budapest occupied by the Romanian army on August 6th. This brief Communist period set Hungary very negative to Soviet Union and Hungarian Jews (most supporters of the Communist government were Jewish which made it just too easy to hate them). Following that Hungary experienced counterrevolution and Miklos Horthy with the consent of Romanian forces marched into Budapest to restore order. He would also restore monarchy and rule as regent.
        2.2.5.2 Again, 1920 - Treaty of Trianon. Hungary loses a lot of territory to Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. 30% of all Hungarians lived outside of this new Hungarian state. The Hungarian political attitude towards Trianon could be summed up by Mindent vissza! ("Return everything!"). The perceived humiliation of the treaty became a dominant theme in inter-war Hungarian politics, analogous with the German reaction to the Treaty of Versailles ( <- according to Wikipedia). Another quote: Hungary lost 84% of its timber resources, 43% of its arable land, and 83% of its iron ore. Although post-Trianon Hungary retained 90% of the engineering and printing industry of the former Kingdom of Hungary, only 11% of timber and 16% iron was retained. In addition, 61% of arable land, 74% of public road, 65% of canals, 62% of railroads, 64% of hard surface roads, 83% of pig iron output, 55% of industrial plants, 100% of gold, silver, copper, mercury and salt mines, and most of all, 67% of credit and banking institutions of the former Kingdom of Hungary lay within the territory of Hungary's neighbors.
        2.2.5.3 Between 1929 and 1938 Hungary was very pro-German and in 1938 it tried to improve diplomatic relations with UK which made the government unpopular in Germany and Italy
        2.2.5.4 To show how much Hungary didn't want to go to war government under Pal Teleki informed Hitler that Hungary will not go to war with Poland in 1939 as a matter of "national honor" and Hungary would not provide German forces passage through Hungary, and joined the Tripartite Pact in 1930 only under immense pressure from Germany.
        2.2.5.5 "By signing the Peace Treaty of Paris of 1947, Hungary again lost all the territories that it had gained between 1938 and 1941. Neither the Western Allies nor the Soviet Union supported any change in Hungary's pre-1938 borders, which was the primary motive behind the Hungarian involvement in the war." -> clear intent to reclaim lost territories from WW1
      2.2.6 Also, to close the loop on Greece - the previous script forcing them to surrender once everything but Crete is occupied will probably be still in use. Logic behind it was pretty solid and I like how it worked at the end
    2.3 Asia
      2.3.1 China
        2.3.1.1 Sun Yat-sen's Nationalist government entered an alliance with Communist Party of China and received support from Soviet Union to attempt to unite the fragmented country, however, he died in 1925 and Chiang Kai-shek took control of Kuomintang - the Nationalist Party. In 1927 Chiang turned on the Communist and chased CPC out of the country. CPC reorganized under Mao Zedong in Yan'an and continued fighting against the Nationalist government. During Japan's invasion on Manchuria in 1936 Chiang believed CPC is a greater threat and preferred to appease the Japanese as he was trying to defeat the Communists and unite the country, however, by December 1936 Chiang's armies suffered significant cassualties and Chiang was forced into a truce with CPC. CPC and KMT formed a united front against the Japanese in Second Sino-Japanese war (1937-1945), but cooperation and coordination was minimal at best. In late 1940-early 1941 clashes between CPC and KMT intensified and despite international urges for a truce until Japanese are defeated, Chiang launched a new propaganda campaign against CPC in 1943. The war mostly weakened Chiang's forces and won popular support in China's rural areas for Mao's government. In 1946 fighting resumed and by 1949 CPC controlled most of the country
      2.3.2 Chinese autonomous provinces
        2.3.2.1 Sinkiang, or Xinjiang. After 1912 it was independent and from 1937 supported by Soviet Union that maintained military base and had several military and economic advisors deployment in the region. Sheng Shicai ruling Xinjiang wanted to join the Soviet Union in 1943 so Chiang Kai-shek moved him to Chongqing (Central China) as the Minister of Agriculture and Forest. In 1949 Kuomintang's commander surrendered Xinjiang to the Communist government.
        2.3.2.2 Guangxi seceded from China in 1911, in 1920-1921 it fought against the Nationalist China in Guangdong–Guangxi War. In 1929 Guangxi was defeated by Chiang's army and even though in 1931 it turned against Chiang again it also supplied large number of troops against Japan
        2.3.2.3 Yunnan was aligned to Nationalist government in Nanjin but heavily protected its autonomy. Critical towards Chiang after Second Sino-Japanese War. Not much besides that. It'll be difficult to properly trick them into war with anyone without too much of a stretch
        2.3.2.4 Xibei San Ma, or the Ma Clique, was probably most supportive of Kuomintang government. Its armies were renamed National Revolutionary Army, fought the Soviet-backed governorn of Xinjiang and the Soviets themselves during Soviet Invasion on Xinjiang in 1934. Took part in Sino-Tibetan war in 1930, and in Second Sino-Japanese War against the Japanese. In 1940s at the command of Kuomintang invaded Xinjiang to intimidate pro-Soviet governor. Fought the Communist China until the cavalry has been all wiped out in August 1949
        2.3.2.5 Siam (Thailand), was ruled by the military since the blodless revolution of 1932, which transformed Siam from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy. The military attempted to roll out new economic reforms, which were called "communist" by most of the government factions and led to an armed rebellion of royalists in 1933 led by Prince Bovoradej. They were eventually defeated and fled to French Indochina. Starting in 1938 Siam would become more fascistic and following of Mussolini's ideas and in 1939 Siam changed name to Prathet Thai - "land of the free" and the government's slogan became "Thailand for the Thai." In 1941 Thailand waged a small-scale war with Vichy France to regain some lost territories, primarily in Laos and Cambodia. Japanese invasion of Thailand on December 8, 1941 and the military alliance Thailand entered effectively made Thailand a puppet state of Japan until the end of the war
        2.3.2.6 Some Chinese provinces (the ones above) have been "China" while maintaining autonomy. Hearts of Iron 3 decided to make them into their own countries to reflect that autonomy. Chiang's Nationalist government wanted to unite whole China but Communist threat to the North and Sino-Japanese war prevented him from making much of a headway. Main points here would be:
          2.3.2.6.1 First of all those numbers are getting ridiculous at this point, lol
          2.3.2.6.2 Communist China alligning more closely to Soviet Union, perhaps as far as an alliance? Following the end of the war with the Japanese Communist China gets into an alliance with Xinjiang and Guangxi to partition Nationalist China since they are all against Chiang at this point, Yunnan getting caught in cross-fire and joining the war on Nationalist China's side. That should sufficiently clean it all up in Asia until we get there later once the war with Soviet Union comes to an end. The only thing that's left would be Tibet. It was nominally under Chinese rule but maintained great autonomy and was incorporated into China in 1951. There were some minor disputes but nothing big enough to justify a full on war
    2.4 Spain
      2.4.1 After the Civil War is done and won Republican Spain will be alligning more closely to the Allies (perhaps entering an alliance with France which was supportive of Republican Spain and Franco feared a French intervention) and declare war on Portugal (Portugal was very supportive of Franco's forces in the Civil War), while Nationalist Spain will enter an alliance with Poland and Italy and allign more closely towards Axis (again, because of Franco's view of France)
    2.5 Turkey?
      2.5.1 After World War 1 Ottoman Empire was broken down by the Entente and large concessions were made to Greece, Italy, Britain, and France
      2.5.2 November 1, 1922 - Turkey abolishes the Sultanat, officially ending 623 years of Ottoman rule
      2.5.3 "After failing in 1939 to get a defensive alliance against Germany with Britain, Turkey maintained neutrality during the war (1939–45)" and in 1945 symbolically declared war on Germany and Japan
      2.5.4 What's probably gonna happen is - I'll make a two-choice script. 1 - we'll demand their unconditional surrender and incorporation into Poland (50/50 AI chance for either) and 2 - we'll demand Turkey joins Axis and fights with us against the Soviets later. History proves that Turkey would apparently much rather have a defensive alliance with the UK rather than join the Axis
    2.6 Scandinavia
      2.6.1 All three countries neutral in World War 1 (not including Denmark as this will be entirely German problem)
      2.6.2 Sweden
        2.6.2.1 Foreign policy concerns in the 1930s centered on Soviet and German expansionism, which stimulated failed efforts at creating Nordic defence co-operation. Sweden followed a policy of armed neutrality during World War II, but thousands of volunteers have helped Finland during the Winter War.
      2.6.3 Norway
        2.6.3.1 The only new information to me is that UK made plans for its own invasion on Norway, Germany was just quicker to act on it
        2.6.3.2 Other than that it's the same story - Norway tried to stay neutral
      2.6.4 Finland
        2.6.4.1 Finnish independence from Russia in 1917 and a brief civil war between "reds" and "whites" in 1918 in which "whites" won
        2.6.4.2 Failed coup attempt in 1932 by a nationalist and anti-communist movement - Lapua Movement
        2.6.4.3 The Soviet Union started to tighten its policy against Finland in the 1930s, limiting the navigation of Finnish merchant ships between Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland and blocking it totally in 1937.
        2.6.4.4 In October 1939 USSR sent an ultimatum to place its military bases in Finland, which was declined, and in November 1939 USSR crossed the border to Finland. The war ended on 13 March 1940 and in December 1940 Finland entered military cooperation with Germany
        2.6.4.5 Same as Turkey? Join us, war, or joining the Axis?
  3. Stealing technology?
    3.1 Confirmed that this is not an option. There is documentation on HoI 1 and HoI 2 but HoI 3 seems to be missing this mechanic
    3.2 Workaround possible with "load_oob = ..." ?
