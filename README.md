Hello friends!

Version1 has been moved to it's own location as we are preparing for a complete overhaul of the script.
If you liked Version1 it is, and always will be, accessible in it's own folder. It continues to be working as intended and no more updates will be made to it

New ideas are currently found in "plans-for-version2" and it will be growing for a while until I have everything I need to start working on the actual script

Stay tuned for more updates! :)

event1 -> Poland accepts German help -> better relations with Germany  + worse relations with Soviets + slightly worse relations with Allies + new units created in the oob part + triggering event2

event2 -> LIT, LAT, EST entering an alliance -> LIT declaring war on POL -> event3

event3 -> BUL declaring war on ROM and GRE stabbing BUL in the back -> event4

event4 -> ALB, YUG declaring war on GRE -> event5

event5 -> HUN goes to war with YUG and ROM (mean_time = 1)

event6 -> when CHI-JAP war is done -> SIN + Guangxi + Communist China go to war with Nationalist China, Yunnan attacks Guangxi

event7 -> Turkey gets two choices. 1 - we'll demand their unconditional surrender and incorporation into Poland (50/50 AI chance for either) and 2 - we'll demand Turkey joins Axis and fights with us against the Soviets later -> triggered with POL holding all Balkans

event8 -> Finland gets two choices. 1 - we'll demand their unconditional surrender and incorporation into Poland (50/50 AI chance for either) and 2 - we'll demand Turkey joins Axis and fights with us against the Soviets later -> triggered when POL controls SWE

event9 -> At the beginning of Civil War: NatSpa - alliance with POL and ITA -> POL sends 2 infantry divsions as volunteers to help Nationalists -> spawn in Barcelona?

event10 -> SPA -> when Civil War is over and RepSPA won -> RepSpa - alliance with FRA + war on POR
