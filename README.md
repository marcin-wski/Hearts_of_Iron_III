## Explanation
It's year 1936... the world has seen World War I and truly hoped that it was the "war to end all wars". This has been proven to be false - Hitler came into power, Germany began training the army and building up the fleet, Soviet Union grows in power and the defeat of 1919-20 did not stop their hopes for spreading the revolution to the rest of the world, Italy has a fascist government, bad things begin happening in Spain even though no one can suspect a civil war incoming, USA goes back to the policy of isolationism, Japan strenghtens their hold over Korea and attacks China, United Nations is an uterly powerless organization that cannot prevent any of this from happening, France and England want peace above everything else...

In sight of all these events Eastern Europe grows worried. Polish right-wing movements understand that the Allies will not go to war, fascistic movements limit their organization and their actions and give their full support to OZN - more moderate alternative - while at the same time undermining the socialist and communist parties and spreading anti-communist propaganda. Thanks to their efforts the public starts looking more favorably towards OZN which after all was the driving force behind the defeat of the Bolsheviks in 1919-20. The Polish public also starts understanding that Soviet armies are quite literally standing on the border. The Polish army gets a surge of volunteers and, thanks to the now right-wing leaning of Polish public, Germany supplies a small quantity of medium tanks straight out of factories.

The Baltic states understand that no one will help them and Soviet Union will soon come knocking, so they all decide that their only option is the unthinkable - another war. Lithuania resents Poland, so that war is easy... buuuuuut Latvia and Estionia are not far behind. Quickly border incidents escalate to a full-blown war. Poland is once again at war.
