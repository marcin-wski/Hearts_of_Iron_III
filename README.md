## Explanation
It's year 1936... the world has seen and lived through World War I and truly hoped that it really was the "war to end all wars". This has been proven to be false - Hitler came into power, Germany began training the army and building up the fleet, Soviet Union grows in power and the defeat of 1919-20 did not stop their hopes for spreading the revolution to the rest of the world, Italy has a fascist government, bad things begin happening in Spain, USA goes back to the policy of isolationism, Japan strengthens their hold over Korea and attacks China, United Nations is an utterly powerless organization that cannot prevent any of this from happening, France and England want peace above everything else...

In sight of all these events Eastern Europe grows more and more worried. Polish right-wing movements understand that the Allies are unlikely go to war even to defend their ally and start reviewing their options. ONR _(Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny)_, a fascistic movement, drastically limits its organization and actions and give its full support to OZN _(Obóz Zjednoczenia Narodowego)_ - a more moderate alternative - while at the same time tirelessly undermining the socialist and communist parties and spreading anti-communist propaganda. Thanks to their efforts the public starts looking more favorably towards OZN, which after all was the driving force behind the defeat of the Bolsheviks in 1919-20. The Polish public begins noticing that the Soviet armies are quite literally standing on the border ready to cross at a moment's notice. The Polish army receives a surge of volunteers ready to once more defend their homeland against the Bolshevik invasion and, thanks to the now strongly right-wing leaning of Polish public, Germany supplies a small quantity of medium tanks straight out of the factory.

Poland is not the only one in this troubling time, however, and the Baltic states understand that no one will help them once the Soviet Union comes knocking. They all decide that their only option is the unthinkable - another war, and soon. Lithuania resents Poland, so their choice seems easy... buuuuuut Latvia and Estonia are not far behind and quickly border incidents escalate to a full-blown war in every direction. Baltic states are now engulfed in war.

Balkans follow the suit - Romania looks hungrily at Bulgaria, Yugoslavia wants to unite with Albania, Hungary wants to re-live their glory days of their Empire, and Greece grows worried of Yugoslavia... No one wants to be first to start the fire, but when a group of Romanian soldiers find themselves on the wrong side of Romanian-Yugoslavian border and chooses to shoot rather than answer questions from the Yugoslavian patrol all hell breaks loose. Yugoslavia crosses the border to Romania while gathering the reserves to take over Albania. Romania launches a large scale offensive into Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Greece preemptively strikes Yugoslavia and rolls through Albanian defense forces. Hungary feels the moment of "now or never" and backstabs Yugoslavia and Romania hoping they will bleed themselves out first. At the end of the day the Balkans are in flames in a brutal war of everyone against everyone. Only Turkey remains neutral... waiting for the right time to strike, perhaps hoping for the rebirth of the Ottoman Empire.

### User choice now
As this scenario is clearly catered to player being Poland, the main thing is to clean up the mess in Baltic states uniting them under the Polish banner and turn your attention south, to Czechoslovakia. Remind the Czechs that you are all from the same Slavic family and bring them to heel with a swift attack cutting through their lines, encircling their capital city, and showing them the prosperity of the Republic of Poland. The next objective would be to observe the Balkans. Romania and Greece are the main players here - Romania is the largest nation with the strongest army in the region, Greece fights basically only on one (northern) front. Once Albania and Yugoslavia are no longer a problem Hungary and Bulgaria will stand for a few weeks before collapsing as well. Roll through the Balkans when you see fit, aiming to take out Romania as a priority - the sooner the better. Once you deal with Hungary and Romania, deal with Bulgaria if it still stands, and cut through Greece. Now this is where an AI choice comes in - once you control Athins and Salonica Greece will receive an option of "bitter peace" and secede all their Balkan possession, holding only to Crete, giving you the opportunity to end the war and not having to build the fleet to take over Crete. Otherwise the war can go on, and on, and on until you do just that. Once the war with Greece is over you should be receiving an invitation to join the Axis soon. Your paternal autocrats hold the parliament in a tight grip and Germany would not let an opportunity like that pass. Once you join the Axis there goes Turkey...

From the (pseudo-)historical standpoint it makes sense - you took over the entire Balkans and control the main Greek cities. In order to avoid total defeat and anihilation Greek government sues for peace, hoping to just keep holding on to Crete. That's a clear win-win as Crete will not really do you any good anyway in a long run. Once you are done with Greece Turkey stands at a difficult place - Poland just took over the Balkans, finalized the war with Greece, and can turn their full attention to Turkey. Aside from that it is clear by now that the war is imminent...
