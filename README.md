Hello friends!

Version1 has been moved to it's own location as we are preparing for a complete overhaul of the script.
If you liked Version1 it is, and always will be, accessible in it's own folder. It continues working as intended and no more updates will be made to it

The scripting part is all done at this point. I just need to find time to write the whole story here again to give some background. A lot has changed since Version1!

Stay tuned for more updates! :)
